# Module1

Refactoring of the Horiseon Marketing HTML and CSS assets: </br>
  Comments added to separate major sections </br>
  Semantic elements were added along with 'alt' attributes for content images to improve accessibility </br>
  Redundant CSS was consolidated to form a more streamlined file as well as repositioning elements in sequential order </br>
  HTML links were fixed and selectors revised to remove unnecessary code </br>
  
  NOTE: I forgot to commit periodically so I simulated commits where I would have committed if I were to refactor a simular project
